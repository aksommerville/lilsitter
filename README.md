# lilsitter

The Tiny version of Sitter.

Carry the children to the goal and don't kill them.

## TODO

- [x] Editor: Visual editing.
- [ ] Final maps, say about fifty of them?
- [ ] Sound effects
- [x] Music
- [ ] Different songs per map. (and not just cycling thru; make a new command for it)
- [x] Hero: Arms and up/down feedback
- [x] Intro splash with high score and music toggle
- [x] Timekeeping
- [x] High score
- [x] Nicer game over splashes, eg stats on Win.
- [x] All-over splash
- [x] Menu card
- [x] More sprites:
- - [x] Electric crocodile
- - [x] Other kids? ...nah 2 is plenty
- - [x] Moving platform
- - [x] Some kind of horizontal hazard, for chimney edges
- - [x] Balloon
- [x] Editor: Maybe clean up the CSS just a little?
- [x] make: Avoid mixing PNG and TSV splashes. Better strategy re data files (as opposed to embedded data)
- [x] Ensure Susie starts travelling the direction she was facing, when tossed.
- [x] Don't draw outline on GOAL SOLID if it touches the screen edge.
- [x] Down-pickup while head covered should work (disable check)
- [x] Auto fail after say 15 seconds with no input -- NECESSARY! You might get in an impossible position
- [ ] Air-jump while holding balloon, shouldn't be possible.
- [ ] Can't win while holding balloon. Can we change that?
- [ ] Maps aren't rebuilding when I change them.
